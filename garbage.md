 1. **Memory Allocation Efficiency**: You can create a comparison program that simulates memory allocation and deallocation in both a garbage-collected language like Python and a non-garbage collected language like C. Track the time and memory usage required to handle a large number of objects in both scenarios. Additionally, you can visualize the memory allocation and deallocation process in both cases using diagrams to illustrate the efficiency of garbage collection in managing memory resources.

2. **Memory Fragmentation**: Develop a test suite that measures memory fragmentation in different scenarios in both garbage-collected and non-garbage-collected languages. By running memory fragmentation algorithms and analyzing the results, you can provide quantitative insights into how garbage collection reduces memory fragmentation, leading to more efficient memory usage.

3. **Dynamic Memory Deallocation**: Create a code example that showcases the difference in handling dynamic memory deallocation between garbage-collected and non-garbage-collected languages. This can include visual representations of memory deallocation patterns and the associated performance overhead in non-garbage-collected languages.

4. **Comparative Benchmarking**: Compile performance benchmarks for specific tasks in both garbage-collected and non-garbage-collected languages. Use real-time measurements to highlight the overhead and performance implications of manual memory management in non-garbage-collected languages versus the efficiencies gained through automatic garbage collection.

5. **CPU Utilization**: Develop a test that measures CPU utilization in both types of languages when performing memory management operations. Provide data-driven insights into the impact of automatic memory management on the overall system resource utilization compared to the manual memory management approach.

Formulating these mathematical measurements and real-time comparisons using code and diagrams will enable you to definitively illustrate the advantages of garbage collectors in programming languages.
